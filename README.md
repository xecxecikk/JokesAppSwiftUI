# JokeApp ‚Äì Programming Jokes in SwiftUI

JokeApp is a minimalist iOS app written entirely in **SwiftUI** that fetches random programming jokes using a public API and allows users to:

- View jokes in a clean, scrollable list
- Read full jokes in a dedicated detail screen
- **Add or remove jokes from favorites**
- **Listen to jokes aloud using text-to-speech**

This project demonstrates networking, simple state management, view composition, and basic accessibility integration (speech synthesis).

## üì¶ Dependencies

This app uses **one external package**:

### üîó [Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire)
- Used to perform HTTP requests to the JokeAPI
- Easy JSON decoding with `responseDecodable`

#### üì• How to add Alamofire via Swift Package Manager
1. In Xcode: `File > Add Packages`
2. Paste the URL:
   ```
   https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire.git
   ```
3. Choose latest version
4. Import in code where necessary:
   ```swift
   import Alamofire
   ```

## üõ† Architecture

This is a small but modular SwiftUI project with the following structure:

| File                  | Responsibility                                     |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `Joke.swift`          | Joke model (decodable + originalText logic)        |
| `JokesViewModel.swift` | Fetching jokes, state management, favorites         |
| `ContentView.swift`   | Main UI with list and toolbar                      |
| `DetailView.swift`    | Detailed view of joke with read/favorite buttons   |
| `ErrorMessage.swift`  | Error model for SwiftUI alert compatibility        |

State management is handled via `@Published` + `@ObservedObject` without Redux or external architecture.
